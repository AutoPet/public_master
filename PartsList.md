# Parts and Software Requirements List

## Electronics
* Servo Actuators
* Feed Level Sensors 
* Arduino Nano?? (  This board will change if we need camera setup. Might need Raspberry Pi for embedded wifi functionality, easy camera setup, and easy sensor and actuator control  )
* Wifi Module
* AC Adapter
* Camera
* Speaker

## Software
* Cross Platform Development Env
* Arduino IDE (OR C/Python Env if Raspberry Pi board is used)

## Physical Components
